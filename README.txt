This project consists of 1) an R script named "project1.R", 2) a collection of C++ files
located in the folder named "c++", together with a file named "Boston.csv", and 3) a PDF
document named "project1-report.pdf" which is the project report.

1) R Script:
To run the R script, simply open the file "project1.R" in RStudio.

2) C++ Project:
To compile the code into an executable file, the following command can be run in a Linux
terminal:

	g++ main.cpp

This will generate an executable file called "a.out". To run the program, simply enter
the following command:

	./a.out

NOTE: In order for the program to run correctly, the file "Boston.csv" must be located
in the current working directory when "a.out" is executed.
